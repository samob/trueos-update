# General TrueOS Information <a name="gentrosinfo"></a>

This section describes where you can find more information about TrueOS and its related projects, file new issues on GitHub, and converse with other users or contributors to the project.

## TrueOS Project Documentation <a name="docs"></a>

A number of [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) generated reStructuredText handbooks are available to introduce you to the TrueOS, Lumina, and SysAdm projects. These handbooks are open source, and users are always encouraged to open GitHub issues or fix any errors they find in the documentation.

### TrueOS Handbook <a name="trueosdoc"></a>

The [TrueOS User Guide](https://www.trueos.org/handbook/trueos.html) is a comprehensive guide to install TrueOS, along with post-installation configuration help, recommendations for useful utilities and applications, and a help and support section containing solutions for common issues and links to community and development chat channels for uncommon issues. There is also a chapter describing the experimental TrueOS Pico project and links to the Lumina and SysAdm documentation. All TrueOS documentation is hosted on the [TrueOS website](https://www.trueos.org).

## Filing Issues or Feature Requests <a name="fileissues"></a>

Due to the number of repositories under the TrueOS "umbrella", the TrueOS Project consolidates its issue trackers into a few repositories:

* [trueos](https://github.com/trueos/trueos) : Used for general TrueOS issues relating to the world environment
* [trueos-ports](https://github.com/trueos/trueos-ports) : Used for ports issues

The TrueOS handbook has detailed instructions to help you report a bug (https://www.trueos.org/handbook/helpsupport.html#report-a-bug). It is recommended to refer to these instructions when creating new GitHub issues. Better bug reports usually result in faster fixes!

To request a feature, open a new issue in one of the related GitHub issue repositories and begin the title with *Feature Request:*.

## Community Channels <a name="community"></a>

The TrueOS community has a wide variety of chat channels and forum options available for users to interact with not only each other, but contributors to the project and the core development team too.

### Discourse <a name="discourse"></a>

TrueOS  has a [Discourse channel](https://discourse.trueos.org/) managed concurrently with the TrueOS Subreddit. New users need to sign up with Discourse in order to create posts, but it is possible to view posts without an account.

### IRC <a name="irc"></a>

Like many open source projects, TrueOS has an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel so users can chat and get help in real time. To get connected, use this information in your IRC client:

* Server name: irc.freenode.net
* Channel name: #trueos (note the # is required)

### Subreddit <a name="subreddit"></a>

The TrueOS Project also has a [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOS/) for users who prefer to use Reddit to ask questions and to search for or post how-tos. A Reddit account is not required in order to read the Subreddit, but it is necessary to create a login account to submit or comment on posts.

## Social Media <a name="socialmedia"></a>

The TrueOS Project also maintains a number of social media accounts you can watch:
